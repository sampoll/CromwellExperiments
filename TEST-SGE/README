Test to run a tiny scatter/gather job on the Channing SGE cluster using the SGE backend. 
Command: java -Dconfig.file=sge.conf -jar cromwell-30.1.jar run tiny.wdl -i tiny.json

Note: capecod has a version of java too old to run Cromwell. Remote nodes seem to have
more recent version. Use "qrsh -l R" to get to backnode, then "java -version" to make
sure the node has 1.8.

Runs four jobs of a R script on cluster nodes to find maximum of a file of
integers, then the same script to find the maximum of the maxima.
