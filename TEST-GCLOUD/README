Test to run a tiny scatter/gather job in the Google Pipelines API

Runs four jobs of a R script on cloud nodes to find maximum of a file of
integers, then the same script to find the maximum of the maxima. 

Make a Google Cloud Project and Google Cloud Storage bucket as described in:
  http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/tutorials/PipelinesApi101/
  Section: Configuring a Google Project

Note: in addition to Google Cloud Storage, Google Compute Engine API, and
  Genomics API, need to enable Google Cloud Storage JSON API

Modify google.conf to change the names of the project and bucket at line 33-34

Command: java -Dconfig.file=google.conf -jar ../cromwell-30.1.jar run tiny.wdl -i tiny.inputs

To see output, log into the Google Cloud Console, click menu (horizontal lines) in upper left, 
  scroll down to Storage, click Browser. Then go to 
  bucket-name/cromwell-executions/wf/<job-id>/call-finalize/finalize-stdout.log
  (The job name is in the screen output from Cromwell.)
  
Note: this is a prototype only, it takes a very long time.
